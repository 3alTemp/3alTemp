I'm Temp (also known as ``TrialTemp``, ``3alTemp``). Self-taught developer, I create a bunch of silly things for my own interests.

Currently working on [BombSquad: Vision Initiative](https://github.com/BombSquad-Modding) *(along with [SoK05](https://github.com/SoK05))*; a community project for the game [BombSquad](https://github.com/efroemling/ballistica) that aims to bring the game's community together and bring more quality content and improvements to both the players and game itself via custom-made plugins, modification packs and documentation for everyone to access.

Feel free to roam and take a peek at my stuff around here! You can also take a look at [My website](https://trialtemp.com/) *(Currently down, Sorry!)* if you're interested at looking at everything I'm making / I've made so far! 🤠

You can also find me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsyDTX7NIc7VNo60MPIwkSg), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/3alTemp) and Discord as ``3alTemp``.
